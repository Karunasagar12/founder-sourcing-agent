Kamel Jazmati,technical,Fintech CTO with startup leadership experience currently based in Riyadh. Demonstrates strong technical and founder signals through current CTO role at a startup.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamelj,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamelj,"Kamel's current role as CTO at a Fintech startup in Riyadh directly addresses multiple key criteria.  His CTO title fulfills the 'cto' technical signal requirement, while his leadership position within a startup demonstrates the 'startup_leadership' founder signal.  His current role in the Fintech industry confirms industry alignment. While years of experience aren't explicitly stated, the CTO title suggests significant experience to reach that level.
