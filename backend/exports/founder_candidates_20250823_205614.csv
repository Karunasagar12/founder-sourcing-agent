Her background as a Biotech engineer with a Stanford PhD and 20+ publications in Nature/Science shows clear industry expertise and significant experience.

Currently chairman at four B2B software startups.,https://linkedin.com/in/mock-robertjohnson,https://linkedin.com/in/mock-robertjohnson,"Robert demonstrates strong founder signals, exceeding the 'previous startup experience' requirement by having founded and exited three companies. His experience in enterprise software is valuable, though it lacks a specific healthcare focus.  While his chairman roles indicate ongoing involvement with startups, they don't provide the same level of operational experience as a CEO/CTO.
