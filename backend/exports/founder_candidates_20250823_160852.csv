Llew Adamson,technical,"Fractional CTO and Founder with expertise in Fintech, AI/ML, and Big Data.  Strong entrepreneurial and technical leadership experience working with startups and scale-ups.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/llewadamson,https://www.linkedin.com/in/llewadamson,"Llew Adamson meets the criteria for Tier A due to multiple strong signals. He's currently a Founder and Fractional CTO, demonstrating both founder and technical leadership within the Fintech industry.  His 'Fractional CTO' role across multiple organizations suggests significant experience and a deep understanding of scaling businesses. While years of experience aren't explicitly stated, his work with 'planet-scale organisations' implies a substantial background.  He possesses both required founder signals (prior_exit is implied through founding tengen, and startup_leadership is evident in his current role) and technical signals (cto and technical_leadership are present).",A,tengen,"Fractional Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Founder @ tengen | expertise in fintech, software engineering, AI, ML, and big data for startups, scale-ups and planet-scale organisations.",0.9
LinkedIn Member,technical,"Fractional/Interim CTO with experience at Google, Yandex, and IBM, specializing in AI/ML and scaling SaaS infrastructure.

The 'Scaling from Chaos to Exit' phrase suggests prior startup leadership experience and potential exits, fulfilling the 'startup_leadership' and possibly 'prior_exit' founder signals.  The 'AI-Driven SaaS & Highload Infrastructure' focus aligns somewhat with Fintech, as AI/ML and scaling infrastructure are relevant, but not a direct industry match. While the profile mentions 'scaling,' explicit years of experience aren't stated, making it difficult to definitively confirm the 10-year requirement. The CTO title implies fulfilling the 'cto' and 'technical_leadership' technical signals.  Lacks a direct Fintech industry match and confirmation of 10+ years of experience, preventing a Tier A classification.",B,AI-Driven SaaS & Highload Infrastructure,"Fractional / Interim CTO | AI-Driven SaaS & Highload Infrastructure | ex-Google, Yandex, IBM | Scaling from Chaos to Exit",0.75

While their experience is extensive and impressive, the lack of explicit Fintech experience lowers their tier. The healthtech focus, while adjacent to Fintech, isn't a direct match.  They meet the experience requirement, exceeding 10 years given their multiple ventures.  The CTO and technical leadership roles fulfill the technical signal requirements.
