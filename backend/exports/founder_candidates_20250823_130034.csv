The Founder & CEO/CTO role at Stremium (acquired) demonstrates 'repeat_founder' (implied), 'prior_exit', and 'startup_leadership' signals.  The CEO/CTO title implies 'cto' and 'technical_leadership'.  While years of experience aren't explicitly stated, the acquisition and C-level position suggest significant experience exceeding the 15-year requirement.  The acquisition also signifies a successful startup, fulfilling the 'startup' keyword. Although Stanford/MIT isn't mentioned, the San Francisco location and successful exit suggest a strong likelihood of a relevant network and high-caliber experience.

Brian Bentow,business,3x exited CTO turned serial entrepreneur and founder/CEO. Strong leadership experience with a proven track record of successful exits.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbentow,https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbentow,"Brian Bentow meets the criteria for Tier A due to multiple strong founder signals (CEO, Co-founder, Serial Entrepreneur, 3x Exited CTO), demonstrating both startup leadership and prior exits.  His ""Serial Entrepreneur"" title implies multiple startup experiences, further strengthening his founder signal.  His experience as a 3x exited CTO provides strong technical leadership signals, fulfilling the technical criteria. While the industry match isn't explicitly stated, his experience with multiple exits suggests a strong understanding of the startup ecosystem.  The 15+ years of experience requirement is implied through his extensive career progression culminating in a CEO role.  The combination of CEO/Founder experience at his current company, along with prior CTO and exit experience, positions him as a highly qualified candidate.",A,Get Saucy,CEO & Co-Founder @ Get Saucy | Autoimmune Disease Advocate | Serial Entrepreneur | 3x Exited CTO,0.95

The CTO & Founder role at AlphaSense, Inc. significantly strengthens their startup and technical credentials. However, critical information regarding prior exits, years of experience, and a clear industry match (serial entrepreneur, startup acquired, exit, Stanford, MIT) is missing.  While the current role implies startup experience, it doesn't confirm the 'prior_exit' criteria.  Due to the lack of information regarding the target industry and experience, they fall short of Tier A but qualify for Tier B.",B,"AlphaSense, Inc","CTO & Founder at AlphaSense, Inc",0.75
