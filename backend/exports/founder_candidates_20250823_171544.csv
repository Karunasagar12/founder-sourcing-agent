They hold a CTO & Product Owner role, demonstrating both technical expertise and startup leadership within the Fintech industry.  The CTO title implies significant technical experience (meeting the 'cto' technical signal), while their current role at a staffing company actively innovating in Fintech, Blockchain, Web3, and tokenization directly aligns with the target industry.  The combined CTO & Product Owner role at a startup implicitly suggests founder-like responsibility and fulfills the 'startup_leadership' signal. While years of experience aren't explicitly stated, the senior role of CTO suggests substantial experience, especially given their additional responsibilities as Product Owner.  Their profile showcases a strong overlap of technical leadership within the desired industry at a startup.",A,Copilots Staffing,CTO & Product Owner | FINTECH & BLOCKCHAIN WEB3 & TOKENIZATION | StartUps & Tech Design.
