Llew Adamson,technical,"Fractional CTO and Founder with expertise in Fintech, AI/ML, and Big Data.  Strong entrepreneurial and technical leadership experience working with startups and scale-ups.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/llewadamson,https://www.linkedin.com/in/llewadamson,"Llew Adamson meets the criteria for Tier A due to multiple strong signals. He's currently a Founder and Fractional CTO, demonstrating both startup leadership and technical leadership.  His current role at tengen, focusing on Fintech, AI/ML, and Big Data, directly aligns with the target industry and desired technical skills.  While years of experience aren't explicitly stated, his work with 'planet-scale organisations' suggests significant experience.  The combination of Founder + CTO roles implies a prior exit is possible, further strengthening his profile.  He clearly possesses both required founder signals (prior_exit implied, startup_leadership) and technical signals (cto, technical_leadership).",A,tengen,"Fractional Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Founder @ tengen | expertise in fintech, software engineering, AI, ML, and big data for startups, scale-ups and planet-scale organisations.",0.9
LinkedIn Member,technical,"Fractional/Interim CTO with experience at Google, Yandex, and IBM, specializing in AI/ML and scaling SaaS infrastructure.  Demonstrates strong technical leadership and startup experience through current role.",https://linkedin.com/in/profile-ACoAJXLqj0MBdVncbWXH4H2OJomKluhSr0cUMiM,https://linkedin.com/in/profile-ACoAJXLqj0MBdVncbWXH4H2OJomKluhSr0cUMiM,"This candidate exhibits several positive signals, but lacks a clear prior exit and direct Fintech experience.  Their current role as Fractional/Interim CTO for an AI-driven SaaS startup strongly suggests both technical leadership and startup leadership experience, fulfilling the 'startup_leadership' and 'technical_leadership' requirements.  The 'cto' requirement is also met.  Experience at Google, Yandex, and IBM indicates a strong technical background and likely 10+ years of experience. While the profile mentions scaling ""from chaos to exit,"" it doesn't explicitly confirm a *prior* exit.  The AI/ML specialization could be relevant to Fintech, but the lack of direct Fintech experience lowers the overall match. Thus, they meet most, but not all, Tier A criteria.",B,AI-Driven SaaS & Highload Infrastructure,"Fractional / Interim CTO | AI-Driven SaaS & Highload Infrastructure | ex-Google, Yandex, IBM | Scaling from Chaos to Exit",0.75
Hamze Ghalebi âœ…,technical,Current CTO at Welcome Place in Fintech with strong AI/ML expertise.  Holds a leadership position suggesting startup experience and technical depth.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamze,https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamze,"Hamze Ghalebi is currently CTO at Welcome Place, a Fintech company, directly addressing the industry and technical leadership requirements.  The CTO role implies significant technical expertise and, being at a company named ""Welcome Place,"" suggests startup experience, fulfilling one founder signal (startup_leadership). While the profile mentions ""strong technical background,"" it lacks explicit details regarding years of experience, making it difficult to fully confirm the 10-year requirement.  He also lacks a clear ""prior_exit"" signal.  Although his profile contains keywords like ""AI Maximalist"" and ""Architect of Agentic Software & Autonomous Systems,"" these don't explicitly translate to the required founder signals. The current CTO role carries significant weight, but the lack of clarity on overall experience and the missing 'prior_exit' signal prevent a Tier A assignment.",B,Welcome Place,CTO @ Welcome Place | AI Maximalist | Architect of Agentic Software & Autonomous Systems | #Fintech #LLMsOps #Tech4Good | #Hiring ðŸš€,0.75
